# Pomodoro Timer Feature

## Overview
The Pomodoro Timer is a productivity feature integrated with the Timetable application. It follows the Pomodoro Technique methodology for time management, allowing users to break their work into focused intervals (typically 25 minutes) separated by short breaks, with longer breaks after a set number of work intervals.

## Key Components

### 1. Frontend Implementation

#### HTML Structure (`app/templates/main/pomodoro.html`)
- Timer display section showing countdown time
- Timer controls (start, pause, reset)
- Session progress indicators (dots representing completed/remaining sessions)
- Task integration dropdown for selecting current tasks
- Customizable timer settings (focus time, short break, long break, session count)
- Instructional content explaining the Pomodoro Technique

#### CSS Styling (`app/static/css/pomodoro.css`)
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Visual feedback for timer states (running, paused, break)
- Progress bar showing elapsed time
- Animation effects for better user experience
- Notification styling for timer completion alerts

#### JavaScript Logic (`app/static/js/pomodoro.js`)
- Class-based implementation of the Pomodoro timer
- State management for timer conditions (running, paused, break)
- Local storage for persistent settings
- Sound notifications for timer events
- Browser notification support
- Task integration for tracking time spent on specific tasks
- Customizable timer settings with validation

### 2. Backend Integration

#### Routes (`app/routes/main.py`)
- `/pomodoro` route that renders the timer page
- Fetches active tasks for the current user to populate the task dropdown

#### API Endpoints (`app/routes/api.py`)
- `/tasks/start/{id}` - Marks a task as in progress when used with the timer
- `/pomodoro/stats` - Returns statistics about task completion and focus areas

### 3. Integration With Tasks

#### Dashboard Integration (`app/templates/main/index.html`)
- "Pomodoro" button added to task cards for direct timer launch with the selected task
- Task data is passed to the timer for tracking progress

#### Navigation Integration (`app/templates/base.html`)
- Added "Pomodoro" link to the main navigation for quick access

## User Experience

### Timer Workflow
1. User selects a task to focus on (optional)
2. User starts the timer for a focused work session (default 25 minutes)
3. Timer counts down, providing visual feedback on progress
4. When timer completes, a notification is shown
5. Timer automatically switches to break mode (short break by default)
6. After completing a set number of work sessions, a longer break is provided
7. Session dots visually represent progress through the complete Pomodoro cycle

### Customization Options
- Focus session duration (default: 25 minutes)
- Short break duration (default: 5 minutes)
- Long break duration (default: 15 minutes)
- Number of sessions before a long break (default: 4)

### Task Integration
- Timer can be started directly from a task card
- Current task is displayed during the timer session
- Completing all Pomodoro sessions for a task can optionally mark the task as complete

## Technical Implementation Details

### Responsive Design
- Adapts to mobile and desktop interfaces
- Maintains usability on smaller screens with reorganized controls

### Offline Capabilities
- Settings are saved to localStorage for persistence
- Can function without internet connection once loaded

### Notification System
- Browser notifications when timer completes
- Fallback to on-screen notifications if permissions not granted
- Sound alerts for timer events

### State Management
- Tracks timer state across page refreshes
- Preserves user preferences for timer durations

## Future Enhancement Possibilities
- Historical tracking of completed Pomodoro sessions
- Analytics on focus time and productivity patterns
- Integration with calendar for scheduling Pomodoro sessions
- Enhanced statistics dashboard
- Team/group Pomodoro sessions
