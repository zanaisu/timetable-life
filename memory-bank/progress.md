# Progress

## Project Status
**Current Phase**: Feature Enhancement

The Timetable project has transitioned from feature development to enhancement and refinement. We have successfully completed the MVP release with core task management and progress tracking functionality. We've also successfully implemented the curriculum management system and enhanced the UI with a modern glass morphism design. The latest enhancement is the reimplementation of the personalized confidence system to help users track their learning progress with confidence levels for each topic and subtopic.
