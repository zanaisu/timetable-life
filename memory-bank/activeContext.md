# Active Context

## Current Focus (3/15/2025)

We have reimplemented the Personalized Confidence System for the curriculum functionality. This system allows users to track their confidence levels for curriculum subtopics and automatically calculates topic confidence based on subtopic data.

### Latest Change:

1. **Re-implemented Confidence Tracking System**
   - ✅ Created confidence models in the database (SubtopicConfidence and TopicConfidence tables)
   - ✅ Implemented `confidence.py` module with utility functions for confidence calculations
   - ✅ Added API endpoints to handle confidence data retrieval and updates
   - ✅ Enhanced curriculum.js with confidence tracking functionality and UI updates
   - ✅ Added CSS styles for confidence UI components
   - ✅ Created helper scripts for database setup and testing
   - ✅ Implemented priority weighting system using formula (7 - confidence_level)²

### Confidence System Implementation Details:

1. **Database Models**
   - Created `SubtopicConfidence` model with default level of 3/5
   - Created `TopicConfidence` model storing percentage (0-100%)
   - Established proper relationships with User, Topic, and Subtopic models
   - Added UniqueConstraint to prevent duplicate records

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/confidence/user/data` - Load all confidence data at once
   - `/api/confidence/user/subtopic/<id>` - Get/update subtopic confidence
   - `/api/confidence/user/topic/<id>` - Get topic confidence
   - `/api/confidence/user/initialize` - Initialize all confidence data

3. **User Interface**
   - Added five colored buttons (red to green) for subtopic confidence selection
   - Implemented color-coded topic confidence bar (0-100%)
   - Added special gold animation effect for 100% confidence
   - Ensured all UI components are mobile-responsive

4. **Data Strategy**
   - Implemented loading all confidence data at once as requested
   - Added client-side caching for better performance
   - Created automatic topic confidence recalculation when subtopic confidence changes

### Previous Focus (3/13/2025)

We had simplified the Curriculum System Implementation by removing the confidence tracking functionality. The curriculum management system was focused solely on educational content organization without confidence and priority tracking.

### Key Features in New Confidence System:

1. **Subtopic Confidence UI**
   - Five colored buttons (red to green) for confidence selection
   - "Confidence X/5" text indicator
   - Default value of 3 for new users

2. **Topic Confidence Visualization**
   - Progress bar showing 0-100% confidence
   - Color-coded ranges:
     - 0-20%: Red
     - 20-40%: Orange
     - 40-60%: Yellow
     - 60-80%: Green
     - 80-100%: Dark Green
     - 100%: Gold with special animation

3. **Database Implementation**
   - SQLAlchemy models with proper relationships
   - Default initialization to 3/5 for new users
   - Automatic calculation of topic confidence from subtopics

4. **Priority Weighting System**
   - Formula: (7 - confidence_level)²
   - Higher weight for topics with lower confidence
   - Used for task prioritization

### Previous Actions:

1. **Curriculum Data Improvements**
   - ✅ Updated curriculum data to fix Psychology topics with clearer descriptions

2. **UI Enhancements**
   - ✅ Implemented glass morphism design with true transparency
   - ✅ Used orange accent colors throughout the application
   - ✅ Enhanced mobile responsiveness for better experience on smaller screens
   - ✅ Added subtle hover effects and animations to improve user experience

### JavaScript Architecture:

1. **Module Organization**
   - Standardized JavaScript module patterns
   - Proper Promise handling for asynchronous operations
   - Comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase

2. **Data Loading Strategy**
   - Loading all confidence data at once for better performance
   - Client-side caching to minimize API calls
   - Well-structured event handling for UI updates

### SQLAlchemy Relationship Best Practices:

1. **Relationship Definition**
   - Used back_populates for clear bidirectional relationships
   - Avoided duplicate relationship definitions
   - Used appropriate cascade behaviors for related records
   - Added proper error handling for edge cases

2. **Database Operations**
   - Added helper methods for common operations (get_or_create)
   - Implemented static calculation methods for derived values
   - Proper transaction management for data integrity

### Latest Work:

1. **Integration with Task Generation** ✅:
   - ✅ Integrated confidence data with task generation system
   - ✅ Implemented the (7 - confidence_level)² weighting formula in topic selection
   - ✅ Applied confidence weighting to subtopic selection
   - ✅ Fixed SQL syntax error in subject distribution calculation
   - ✅ Fixed 'InstrumentedList' filter error in task generation
   - ✅ Added comprehensive error handling for all task generation processes
   - ✅ Created test script to verify task generation with confidence integration
   - ✅ Modified task subtopic selection to respect user's study hour preferences
   - ✅ Fixed Biology overrepresentation by implementing two-stage selection process
   - ✅ Created comprehensive test script to verify subject distribution balance

### Upcoming Work:

2. **Analytics Integration**:
   - Track confidence changes over time
   - Visualize progress in learning different topics
   - Generate insights from confidence patterns
